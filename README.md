# Calculator (Basic)
A simple calculator made with html, js and some css. Just my very first project as a beginner.

This is my first project since I have started learning web development. I read and learned about html, css and js. I watched some random basic tutorial on YouTube. After that I tried to improve the code with my own constirubtions (the tutorial used a lot of html content, I used more JavaScript). I also took my time on the css part to give it a somehow 'modern' style to the calculator. 

This is also my first repository btw.
